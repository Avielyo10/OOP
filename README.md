### Data
All the data in this project is from an app called 'WiggleWifi'.  
This app is an android app that gives us a lot of data on the device, like MAC address, SSID, lat, lon, alt, etc.  
All the data is stored on '.csv' files.

### Wifi Scan
Wifi scan is defiend as one record from the app.

### Wifi Scans 
Wifi scans is defiend as the top ten most strongest 'Wifi scan'-s by signal.

### Writing Package
In the Writing Package I used openCSV to simply write the data to '.csv' file and JAK to write it to '.kml' file so we can see our data on Google Maps.
